                    <p>“Research in framing was spearheaded by classic experiments by Nobel Prize Winner Daniel Kahneman
                        and his collaborator Amos Tversky, their research upended the assumption that humans behave
                        rationally.”
                        Guardian</p>
                    <p>“Although conceptually framing seems pretty straightforward, the reality is that most people
                        don't do it well.”

                    <p>“While both framing and spin involve the packaging of ideas, 'framing the debate' is as different
                        from spin as coffee is to whiskey.”

                        <p>COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR</p>
                        <p>We are living in the age of 24/7 rolling news coverage and wall-to-wall news channels. The
                            amplification of social and online media has only exacerbated this. Has this created a
                            crisis of
                            framing: does the constant exposure of our brains to this information embed ideological
                            frames
                            like never before? </p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>“Let's start with a simple fact.”</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>WEHLING<br>That's a great question. The answer is multi-layered. Let's start with a simple
                            fact:
                            frames are
                            a matter of everyday cognition. We think, speak and act according to frames. It's the most
                            normal thing in the world. Frames are cognitive structures acquired via world experience.
                            They
                            tell us what things mean. Say you and I walk down a hallway and you hold open a door. A
                            simple
                            action. No language needed. A frame is activated in my mind telling me I should walk through
                            the
                            door. Simple as that. Now, in political debate, frames are constantly activated via
                            language.
                            Why? Political battle is a brawl over conflicting interpretations of facts. Are taxes a
                            “burden”
                            or “responsibility”? It depends on the frame guiding your beliefs about taxes. What has
                            changed?
                            At least three things: first, the quantity of frame exposure. We constantly consume
                            political
                            messages, online or otherwise, and the more often we digest frames, the more they coin our
                            world
                            perception. Second, via online media, political groups can widely distribute frames on their
                            own
                            terms. Third, misinformation has become a big problem. Language that propagates frames with
                            no
                            factual basis whatsoever has gone through the roof. We should be acutely aware of the
                            language
                            we and others use. Because language invokes frames, repetition entrenches frames in our
                            minds,
                            and those frames guide our actions.

                        <p>COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR<br>In 2012, you co-wrote The Little Blue Book: The Essential Guide to
                            Thinking and Talking
                            Democratic. Among others, it makes the point that progressives fail to match their moral
                            ideals
                            with their communications. Is it because the challenges our world face are easier answered
                            by
                            simplistic messages than nuanced arguments?
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>“It's not that easy.”</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>WEHLING<br>It's not that easy. Let's dig in. First, progressive beliefs tend to rely on
                            what's
                            called
                            systemic causal reasoning. Their beliefs about what causes things in the world tend to be
                            complex. Conservatives tend to favour direct causal arguments. Example: you can say
                            someone's
                            unemployment is a direct result of his laziness. Or you can say it has systemic causes: the
                            education system, social inequality, under regulated labour markets. But look, at the end of
                            the
                            day, whether you are a conservative or progressive, there's always language to cut to the
                            chase
                            of your moral beliefs. Take regulations. Progressives tend to favour them because
                            regulations
                            protect people - against exploitation, against pollution, against harmful food ingredients.
                            Honest and powerful language for that perspective would be to talk about “protections”, not
                            “regulations”. The latter infers that regulating people is the major moral imperative, not
                            protecting them. A very different idea.

                            By drawing on images of fear - being “swamped” by refugees, or being “controlled” by distant
                            Brussels, for instance - do populist arguments benefit from negativity bias?

                    <h2>“Out of a sudden a fistfight erupts at the bar.”</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>WEHLING<br>Negativity bias is a simple psychological mechanism: we tend to attend to negative
                            things. If you
                            catch a beer with a colleague, and out of a sudden a fistfight erupts at the bar between two
                            people. You pay attention to those two folks, not the 30 people sitting peacefully at their
                            tables. A week later, you will reminisce on the fight, not the peaceful guests. Despite a
                            2:30
                            ratio! That's the negativity bias: negative information is more readily attended to and
                            remembered. And this can skew our perception. We may perceive the world as more negative and
                            dangerous than it is. Ponder what this means for politics: if you constantly talk about a
                            “refugee flood”, which construes refugees as a dangerous natural disaster, or the “shackles
                            of
                            Brussels”, which construes the EU as an imprisoner, then yes - there is no doubt you will
                            benefit from the negativity bias.

                            In your talk at The Circle event in Budapest this year, you made the point that
                            Progressives/Liberals repeatedly fall into the trap of repeating frames put forth by their
                            opponents. For our readers, could you summarise that trap?

                    <h2>“I don't think Hunter is a crooked son of a gun”.</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>WEHLING<br>Sure. It's a simple truth about reasoning. We cannot not think. If I say, “I'm not
                            talking about
                            Donald Trump”, you think of one and one person only: the 45th President of the United
                            States. By
                            negating the frame, I activate it in your mind. What's inferred for politics? If you truly
                            care
                            about your perspective, not that of your opponent, put forth your own frames instead of
                            negating
                            your opponent's. You believe Hunter Biden isn't corrupt? Then don't repeat Trump's
                            perspective
                            by saying “I don't think Hunter is a crooked son of a gun”. In politics and elsewhere in
                            life,
                            it's always best we say what we believe - not what we don't believe! [...]

                            How can you address a frame you disagree with without repeating it or conjuring it up again
                            in
                            the minds of your audience?

                    <h2>“It's the honest way to communicate.”</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>WEHLING<br>Always start with your beliefs. It's the honest way to communicate. The frames
                            that
                            guide your
                            thinking should exist in your language. If you believe in protecting people, speak of
                            “protections”, not “regulations”. The facts you discuss will be the same. But your language
                            will
                            reflect what you as an individual truly care about. If you discuss migration, no one holds a
                            gun
                            to your head forcing you to say, “Migrants are not a natural disaster”. You can simply say
                            that
                            “migrants are humans”. What else? Take responsibility for our discourses by deconstructing
                            frames! Say you're an environmentalist and you find yourself chatting with uncle Jim over
                            Thanksgiving dinner. He holds opposite beliefs from you. He says environmental regulations
                            are
                            unpatriotic because they harm American businesses. You now know uncle Jim cares about
                            patriotism. Mention that his frame defines patriotism solely as a matter of business growth.
                            Talk about the fact that protecting the lands and wildlife of America, like the bald eagle
                            as
                            national symbol, is also a patriotic concern. Talk about clean air for Americans to breathe,
                            clean water for Americans to drink, clean rivers for Americans to swim in. Take his concern
                            for
                            patriotism seriously. Uncle Jim clearly cares about the nation and the well-being of
                            Americans.
                            Offer a perspective that makes environmental protection - not economic regulation - a
                            patriotic
                            concern. Really, this is not rocket science. We all should do this more often. By
                            deconstructing
                            our language and frames, we gain freedom. The freedom that comes with a deeper understanding
                            of
                            our own frames and those of others. Good communication doesn't mean agreeing with one
                            another.
                            It means understanding and maybe even learning from one another. [...]

                            COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR<br>Does the concept of framing refute the idea that it is possible to
                            see
                            the world objectively?

                    <h2>“None is 'objectively' truer than the other.”</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>WEHLING<br>That depends on how we define objectivity. If we mean that humans can process
                            facts as
                            they exist in the world without interpreting them, then no. Facts get their meaning through
                            frames. Take a low-fat gouda at your local grocery store. Is it 80 per cent fat free or does
                            it
                            contain 20 per cent fat? You cannot reason about the factual nature of that cheese without
                            using
                            one of two frames. That's fine. Both are true. But none is 'objectively' truer than the
                            other.
                            Which brings me to the second part of my answer: if we use 'objectivity' in a very, very
                            loose
                            sense to ask whether frames capture facts that truly exist, then yes. Frames can be - and
                            usually are - different but equally truthful interpretations of the factual world. And in
                            politics? In politics, we most certainly don't perceive issues in one universally
                            legitimate,
                            objective way. If that were the case, we wouldn't fight over what is good governance.
